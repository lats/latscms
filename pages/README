To add a new category create a new directory.
To add a new post add a new file to the directory the post belongs to.
E.G.
Create a new file in /path/Posts/ named "SOMETHING.md"

Header.md and Footer.md are special cases. 
These control the contents for the page header and footer respectively.
No other .md files in /path/ will be read into the site.
If the files are removed the divs will still be added so that you can control this through the CSS instead if you like.

**One gotcha at the moment is that files are output in alphanumeric order instead of creation order (or the reverse).
**I'm working on that, but for now I recommend using a naming scheme like:
ZZZZ.md
ZZZY.md
...
AAAA.md

Contents of the files should plain-text with markdown formatting.
Great "cheat sheet" of markdown shortcuts:

Example:

ZZZZ.md
#My First Post
##This is a subtitle
Everthing else is regular text. Except when I do _this_ or  
|When|I|Do|This|

> We can quote things like this  

We can [make links](google.com) too.

If you want a specific html tag you can <add>it</add> freely.

<div class="someclass">
This includes divs like this one.
</div>

and many more!
