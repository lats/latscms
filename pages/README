To add a new category to the page simply create a new directory.
To add a new post add a new file of to the path you wish it to 
appear under. EG. if you want to make a new post called 
Frank was here!
Create a new file in /path/Posts/ named "Frank\ was\ here\!.md"

Contents of the files should plain-text with markdown formatting.
Great "cheat sheet" of markdown shortcuts:

Example:

My\ first\ post.md
#My First Post
##This is a subtitle
Everthing else is regular text. Except when I do _this_ or  
|When|I|Do|This|

> We can quote things like this  

We can [make links](google.com) too.

If you want a specific html tag you can <add>it</add> freely.

<div class="someclass">
This includes divs like this one.
</div>

and many more!

Home.md is a special case. This is your landing page. 
Edit the file, but do not change the filename.
There should be only 1 file with "Home" as its category. 
As with any other page it accepts markdown and whatever else you want to add.
