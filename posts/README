Posts should be named in the following format:

Category_Title_Date_Author.md

Category and Title are required, Date and Author are not.

Contents of the files should plain-text with markdown formatting.
Great "cheat sheet" of markdown shortcuts:

Example:

Posts_My first post.md
#My First Post
##This is a subtitle
Everthing else is regular text. Except when I do _this_ or  
|When|I|Do|This|

> We can quote things like this  

We can [make links](google.com) too.

If you want a specific html tag you can <add>it</add> freely.

<div class="someclass">
This includes divs like this one.
</div>

and many more!
