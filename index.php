Hello reader of code! This 'simple' index page is designed to read a specific directory, as denoted by the $path variable. 
It then takes the files it finds in that path, specifically looks for a certain file type (in this case .md), and then outputs
the files it sees, in read order, to the page. These files are very specifically named to allow for the rest of the page magic
to work proprely. See the README file in ./posts for more information on these files. The site itself is built via an echo of
three main vairables: $html_head, $html_body, and $html_foot. Head and foot are essentially static, while body is created using
a series of append executions ($var .= data).
